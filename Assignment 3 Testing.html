<p>Our group will participate in multiple waves of testing, initially we will have an alpha prototype test for the product. Ideally this build will only be sent to individuals handpicked by our group. Ideally these individuals would be industry specialist and journalists interesting in taking an early look our product and supplying our group with valuable feedback we can use to improve our product. The next phase of our development and prototype testing will be a beta build of the smart mirror. This build will be open to the public for purchase, ideally the product will be purchased by an individual with the understanding that the product is a pre-release build. The customer at this point should expect an un-polished and un-finished product. Similar to the alpha build, it is crucial for the user to provide us with more valuable feedback to improve the product over time. The ideal tester for this stage will be an individual that is interested a smart mirror, plain and simple. The user should be interested in this brand new product, understanding that there will be some growing pains, and also willing to work with us, the company, to improve the product over time so eventually get to a full product available for sale.</p><p>Our group will participate in multiple waves of testing, initially we will have an alpha prototype test for the product.
