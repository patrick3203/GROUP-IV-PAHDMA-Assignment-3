    During week 1, the group will meet up together and look through the requirements for assignment 3. In the 		meeting, the group will look through assignment 3 specifications and go through each section one by one to 		gain an understanding of what should be written in each section. Once we have a brief understanding of what 	should be written in each section, we will create a checklist of what needs to be completed in the week or by
    the next team meeting.

    In week 2, the group will reflect on what was done well in assignment 2 and what could have been improved. By
    reflecting and obtaining the feedback from assignment 2 means that we can turn what we did badly on in the
    previous assignment and fix it in the current assignment. After when we have looked back on the pros and cons
    of our previous assignment, we would discuss with the roles that each individuals would like to do or allocate
    roles that fit to the individual's past experience.
