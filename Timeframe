    During week 1, the group will meet up together and look through the requirements for assignment 3. In the 		meeting, the group will look through assignment 3 specifications and go through each section one by one to 		gain an understanding of what should be written in each section. Once we have a brief understanding of what 	should be written in each section, we will create a checklist of what needs to be completed in the week or by
    the next team meeting.

    In week 2, the group will reflect on what was done well in assignment 2 and what could have been improved. By
    reflecting and obtaining the feedback from assignment 2 means that we can turn what we did badly on in the
    previous assignment and fix it in the current assignment. After when we have looked back on the pros and cons
    of our previous assignment, we would discuss with the roles that each individuals would like to do or allocate
    roles that fit to the individual's past experience. By allocating the roles/jobs to each team member of their
    liking, will mean that they will enjoy doing the task given and will complete it to the best of their ability.
    Once the roles/jobs are allocated, the group will discuss with one another of what would make the Smart Mirror 
    unique in comparison to other products like Google Home.

    During week 3, the group members will come together and update on what have been started on or what has been
    completed that was given in the previous weeks. If any members are unable to complete the given work, any of
    members in the group that have some extra time on their hands can help assist the individual that needs help
    to ensure that work is spread out equally and fairly. When majority of the tasks are completed, we will
    allocate some individuals to edit the sections of work in the assignment, ensuring that it fits the assignment
    specifications and edit out words or spelling to make it more coherent.

    This is week 4 of the project where all documents for assignment 3 should have been edited, proof-read and
    improved to then by added in the groups repository in each individual's branch to reflect the work done by
    each individual. Once all the documents are uploaded into the groups respository, a member will bring all
    files and documents into the master branch where all the completed work will be brought together. Another 
    individual will take all the documents and files from the master branch and put it together on a AWS website
    where they will host a HTML website that contains CSS and design the website to look neat and tidy. The files
    and documents will then be added to the website which will then be double checked and be submitted to the
    assignment 3 link to the group website.

    <td>
    In week 5, we would create a physical or paper protoype to create an understand of how it will look, what are
    the functions of the mirror and how will it help assist the end user. The very first prototype will be simple
    to ensure that it is not overcomplicated and easy to understand for everyone. After creating the protoype, we
    would need to receive feedback from random indivduals, which will be done through beta testing, to understand
    their perspective of the Smart Mirror and use the feedback to improve the prototype. We would ensure to ask 
    for their consent if they would like to take part of the face-to-face interview or online survey to ensure 
    that their private information is secured and obtain the necessary feedback to improve the product.

    </td>
    <td>
    In week 6, the plan is to use the feedback from the previous week and come back with the group to discuss what
    they have recieved as feedback, what could be improved and what was good, and discuss what could be done to 
    avoid or fix the product that users did not particularly like. By ulitising the feedback, we can now create a
    brief understanding of what the user wants in the end products and what they would like to be in it. We will 
    discuss as a group on how to approach and implement these new changes to the Smart Mirror. Adapting from the 
    first prototype and improving it based on the feedback received, we will have a new and improved prototype to
    see if any users like or dislike.

    Once we have implemented the feedback received from those participants that were willing to take part of the
    prototype testing, we would go back and ask randoms if they would like to participate in the testing to 
    further improve the prototype. We would then need to check on the feedback if they fit the criteria of the 
    results to be used and seperate the criticism received. We would then need to update on what the users like
    and what they dislike in order to improvoe our prototyping.
