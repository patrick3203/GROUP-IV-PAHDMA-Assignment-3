 Our project idea is a Smart Mirror that is designed to assist the elderly and disabled to make their lives easier, whilst creating a smarter way to live for individuals seeking a tech savvy life. Additionally, the Smart Mirror will also be a cosmetic item in the house as it will be built into a common item that every house owns. The Smart Mirror will include features that will allow the elderly go about their daily life without inconvenience such as: Daily reminders, Calendar, News, Health analysis (includes sleep and fitness), music, security control, temperature control, lighting control and a smartwatch feature. What makes our Smart Mirror rather unique in comparison to other smart devices such as the Google Home, is how it is able to blend it with the common item in the house which allows more space to be used. Furthermore, we aim to develop secondary Smart Mirrors to be located throughout a household for full user control.

 The Smart Mirror is a project that can be completed alone however it is recommended to have a few people working on it as it could be time consuming for one individual. To complete the Smart Mirror project, the individuals will be required to have learned/understand Python, a programming language, used to program the Raspberry Pi B+ model that will allow the Smart Mirror to function accordingly. To build the Smart mirror, materials such as a Raspberry Pi B+ model (has built in Wi-Fi and bluetooth, HDMI compatible and 4 USB sockets), a two-way mirror (a mirror that is transparent of one side[glass] and a mirror on the other), monitor that contains a HDMI connector, HDMI cable (used to connect both the Raspberry Pi and the Monitor together to allow display behind the mirror) and materials to hang the mirror.

 The main goals that we would like to achieve is for our end users to enjoy using the product in order to achieve maximum efficiency for the elderly. One of our main goals is to create an understanding of which competitors in the market sell products that are similar to the Smart Mirror. By knowing who the competitors are in the market, it will help the project group create an understanding of who your competitors are, so they can figure out what their product offers in comparison to other competitor products in order to further improve what works for the competitors and use it in our own personal product. They can use this information to understand what makes this Smart Mirror unique compared to the competitors product and what can make this product stand out in the market. 

Another goal for our product is to make it rather unique compared to other similar products. By taking this step of making it a “one-of-a-kind” good on the market, it distinguishes the item itself from other similar goods on the market. It ensures promotion of the product brand, as it is different in some way but contains some similar features of other goods. Additionally, the project needs to be created to assure that user groups would want to buy the unique product that is particularly different to comparable items. By considering this goal in mind during the Smart Mirror project, it will help construct ideas and pathways to be built upon the Smart mirror.

Furthermore, another objective that they would have to keep in the back of our minds is to physically bring the project to life. Firstly, we would have to build a prototype to give us a brief understanding on how the Smart Mirror will look and functions. We can then comprehend the users perspective of the product and how the mirror will work. As we build the prototype, we will require to spend time to learn how the software will  work, the Raspberry Pi B+ model. To overcome the problem, we will be required to learn Python, a programming language that we have not had any experience in, as we do not have much coding experience in comparison to what we would like to achieve. To help resolve as many issues as possible, we have decided for the prototype that we would split up the parts to allow it to be achievable and measurable.

The steps that will be taken will be small and completed slowly at the beginning to ensure that all the tasks are completed at the best of our ability. By completing our primary goals, creating a smart mirror that blends in with the environment at home with a clean design and to help the elderly user group. In the long run, by completing the small tasks will help achieve our primary goals and help us create more smaller goals to work with. 

 The current features we will implement to our project include: Calendar and reminders, Local or worldwide news, Local weather, Health/Fitness and sleep analysis, Music, Security control, smart watch compatibility and can be utilised through voice command or through an application on the phone. A unique feature of our smart mirror is that it will provide a brief summary or rundown of what is going to occur during the day such as meetings and work. 

The story of our Smart Mirror began with one of our group members wanting a smart mirror for personal use and decided on making the Smart Mirror even better. We then shared our own project ideas and had a discussion one which project ideas were interesting and we all decided that the Smart Mirror project was interesting to all of us so we decided that our group project was going to be the Smart Mirror. We got together as a group and discussed the features that we would like to implement to the Mirror in order to save time and create a cleaner look. Our group then decided how the mirror could be accessed, either through voice, mobile application or touch screen, to improve the effectiveness of the item. Additionally, we have brainstormed what brings motivation to create this project, special features and what will the outcome be if we bring our project to life. [What stage would we like it to reach]

Some dead-ends that we have encountered during the process of our discussions was what makes our product unique compared to other similar products that are already in the market. When creating a prototype, another issue that we have to face is the skill to write Python, a programming language used to program the Raspberry Pi B+. To help resolve this problem, we decided that it was necessary to learn the Python language and in the long-term, we will have another skill in our pockets that we can use in the future. Another problem that we have encountered was how the user would interact with the mirror, either the user walks up to it or through voice recognition, which is required to understand how accessible the mirror is to the user.
