Roles

Our team members are fairly new to the IT field and we believe that having a flexible structure for our roles will give us an opportunity to learn and explore different skills during this project. 

The big advantage is that all members get to try a new position and experience the new role every couple of weeks. Another factor that made us decide for this structure is the similarity with our Ideal Jobs. Diversity of the tasks will force us to explore something new and we might like and change our future plan or we might just be more certain about it. Either way, we will benefit from rotating the roles.

A challenge that comes with this flexibility is the added difficulty to complete this project on time. Having to learn a new skill every couple of weeks is likely to delay our deliverables. More information on that is included in the branch related to Risks of our project.

At this initial stage of the project, the first 4 weeks, we have assigned members with individual tasks to  meet the requirements and ensure the delivery of our assignment on time.
Each week there have been two meetings. Every meeting our team goes through our checklist of tasks and we rotate between each member to hear what each one has been working on. 
When a task is finalised it is submitted to our Git repository and all members read and review.

All the topics of our assignment were discussed as a group and we helped each other to complete the tasks. Brainstorming and referencing tools and other materials has shown to be very helpful to all of us.
 
In spite of our flexible role structure, we did specify some tasks and roles during the initial 4 weeks given for the assignment. These include but are not limited to:

 	-Management of the master branch on Git, a role performed by Patrick. Each member has their own branch to upload content they have been working on but Patrick is in charge of pulling the final version in the master branch. Patrick, along with Derek, did the proof reading for the final version of the assignment.
	-Improvement of our current non-machine generated HTML-CSS website was assigned to Hien. Features of the website were decided as a team and Hien did the final development and implementation of it. Another task assigned to him was to find out more about testing of our product and present us with information on how it could be done.
	-The tools necessary to bring our project to life were briefly discussed by the team and Angel was in charge of presenting us with the final version. He looked into what software could be used and what parts would be necessary for the product.
	-Melanie was responsible for presenting us with the feedback from Assignment 2 and to flag what needed to be improved and what was done well. After this discussion, she made relevant changes to the material. She also took care of our Agenda during each meeting, which kept us on track during the expansion of our project.
- After discussing our aims, the tasks of refining our project objective and finding the risks  involved with it was given to Ary. He also kept us updated on any new announcements, changes or requirements not met during the development of our assignment.
	- The written section related to Plans and Progress was assigned to Derek. He had the job to take into account our meetings and the other sections of our project to build a basic structure of how he would write this section. He made relevant changes to this section quite often because as our project developed our plans also changed.


In the future of our project we look forward to trying different roles and strengthening our skills on different tasks.
