<h1>Plans and Progress</h1>

<hr>

<p>
	Our project idea is a Smart Mirror that is designed to assist the elderly and disabled to make their lives easier, whilst creating a smarter way to live for individuals seeking a tech savvy life. Additionally, the Smart Mirror serves its purpose as an everyday item, camouflaging as a common element displayed in every household. The Smart Mirror will include features that will allow our users to go about their daily lives with convenience and efficiency, simultaneously promoting productivity. Functions specialising in productivity include calendar, health analysis and news. Aside from productivity features, the Smart Mirror also functions as a Smart Home tool, where it offers music, security, temperature and lighting control. What makes our Smart Mirror rather unique in comparison to other smart devices such as the Google Home or Amazon Echo, is how it is able to blend in with common items in a house, allowing more space to be used. Furthermore, we aim to develop secondary Smart Mirrors to be located throughout a household for full user control. Another difference is the smartwatch feature which is completely unique to other smart assistants on the market. <br><br>
	
	There are programs and software available for DIY Smart Mirror’s that function on a smaller scale, allowing individuals to create this project by themselves at home. However, we aim to create a fully functioning Smart Mirror as a team where we can combine and share our ideas. To complete the Smart Mirror project, we will allocate roles and split tasks between members based on their strengths. The software team will be required to have learned or already understand Python, a programming language used to program the Raspberry Pi B+ model that will allow the Smart Mirror to function accordingly. We will also have a user experience/user interface team to ensure that the design and user experience is to optimal standards. To build the Smart Mirror, materials such as a Raspberry Pi B+ model (has built in Wi-Fi and bluetooth, HDMI compatible and 4 USB sockets), a two-way mirror (a mirror that is transparent on one side (glass) and a mirror on the other), monitor that contains a HDMI connector, HDMI cable (used to connect both the Raspberry Pi and the Monitor together to allow display behind the mirror) and materials to hang the mirror will be required. Since the mirror is designed to be a small footprint that occupies less space to create the maximum benefit for the user, the Smart Mirror will hanged on the wall using a French Cleat which requires wood, circular saw to cut the wood at a 45 degrees angle and some screws and wood to bring it all together. An alternative that can be used to hang the mirror on the wall is hooks to hang the mirror if it is not too big nor too heavy. Additionally, users have the option to purchase mirrors of different sizes built with the same functions as the larger mirror. This can be used as a bathroom mirror, dressing mirror, cosmetic mirror or a body length mirror. <br><br>
	
	The main goal we would like to accomplish is for our end users to enjoy using the product in order to achieve maximum efficiency, productivity and convenience. Ideally, we want our users to make full use of the Smart Mirror while going about their daily lives. When the final prototype of the Smart Mirror is created, it will need to fulfill our main objective that is to blend in with a home environment, help the elderly and disabled and implement smart technology in the lives of individuals seeking a Smart Home life. We want to give those who are usually dependent on others to do simple tasks such as lock doors, turn on/off lights, control heating and cooling, some independence and a feel of control. Additionally, we want to promote a healthier and more productive lifestyle which is offered by the Smart Mirror. <br><br>
	
	One of our personal goals is to have a further understanding of which competitors in the market sell products that are similar to the Smart Mirror. By knowing who the competitors are, it will help the team strive to create something different from what is already offered, motivating us to aim towards something extraordinary. We can use this information to understand how to make this Smart Mirror unique and what can make this product stand out from the rest of the market. By taking this step of making it a “one-of-a-kind” good on the market, it distinguishes the item itself from other similar goods on the market. It ensures promotion of the product brand, as it offers fan favourites from similar assistants, whilst containing our own touch which we hope to prove is much better. The project will be created to assure user groups will purchase a unique product that is particularly different to comparable items. By having this goal in mind during the Smart Mirror project, it will help construct ideas and pathways to be built upon the Smart Mirror. <br><br>
	
	Another objective that we would need to keep in the back of our minds is to physically bring the project to life. Firstly, we would have to build a prototype to give us a brief understanding on how the Smart Mirror will look and how it functions. Furthermore, we will need to design the interface and ensure that its usability is up to standards. We can then comprehend the user's perspective of the product and how the mirror will work. To gain a greater understanding, we will gather users to test our product and observe their behaviours and how they interact with the Smart Mirror. As we continue to build the prototype, we will be required to spend time learning how the software will  run and how it will function. For the project, we will consider the Raspberry Pi B+ model. To overcome any problems, we will be required to learn Python, a programming language that we have not had any experience in, as we do not have much coding experience in comparison to what we would like to achieve. To help resolve as many issues as possible, we have decided for the prototype that we would split up the parts to allow it to be achievable and measurable. We will also acquire assistance from professionals or potential partners with experience and knowledge in programming. <br><br>
	 
	The steps to be taken upon the completion of this project will be small and gradual in the beginning to ensure that all the tasks are completed at the best of our ability. This will allow us to approach our goals with a steady hand, making sure nothing is neglected. In the long run, completing tasks bit by bit will take larger workloads off our shoulders, creating a more realistic and achievable objective. This will also allow us to spot any errors or problems during the early stages, as we are able to carefully examine each set of tasks each week rather than doing a lump sum of work which has the potential to have hidden errors. <br><br>
	
	The current features we will implement to our project include: calendar and reminders, local or worldwide news, local weather, health/fitness and sleep analysis, music, security control, lighting control and temperature control. A special feature we will include is a smartwatch compatibility feature. The Smart Mirror can be utilised through voice command or through an application via smartphone. For calendar and daily reminders, users can create personalised schedules to organise their days and events. On command, the Smart Mirror voices the users’ routine and informs them of daily tasks needed to be completed. It will also provide a brief summary or rundown of what is going to occur during the day such as meetings, work or class schedules. In regard to health analysis, users have the ability to track their health (mental and physical), menstruation, fitness and sleep. Feedback will be given along with recommendations to improve their current state and they will be able to view their progress through charts. An extra feature that comes with this are words of encouragement and affirmations from the Smart Mirror, which users can utilise if they need extra motivation and drive. As for news, users can watch or read local and global news reports. With the use of smart technology such as smart speakers, smart cameras/smart locks, smart bulbs and smart heating and cooling, users will have the ability to set a command and control these facilities from any room in their household, whether it be by voice or mobile. This feature is especially useful for the eldery and disabled, so we have a focus on this to make it as accessible as possible. Our special feature included is the smartwatch functionality. The watch tracks the user’s heart rate and has the ability to understand their emotions and health. From this, the watch will ask permission to play music through the Smart Mirror based on mood. Another benefit from this is health tracking. In the event a user shows signs of emergency outside of their home, contacts will be alerted on their phone and all Smart Mirror’s in the user’s house will be alerted, displaying the user’s location for those at home to see. <br><br>
	
	Our Smart Mirror project didn’t appear out of nowhere. This is the story of how we came about this idea: One morning Ary woke up and began his morning routine to get ready for University. When in the bathroom he found himself creating a plan for the day in his head while looking at himself in the mirror brushing his teeth. He then returned to his bedroom where he changed into the clothes he would wear to RMIT that day. Before he left his bedroom, he looked at his outfit in the mirror and said to himself “I hope what I am wearing is appropriate for today’s weather.” He made his way into his kitchen where he ate breakfast and prepared a lunch to bring to RMIT. Before leaving his house, he made one more glance into the mirror right next to his front door. Ary then left the house and continued on his way to RMIT. About 2 and a half hours later when Ary was in a tutorial for his class, Introduction to Information Technology, Ary remembered that his partner had created a list of items that she would have liked for him to pick up form Woolworths on his way home from RMIT. Ary said to himself, “I always forget the list, every time!” At this very moment Ary decided that he wanted a smart assistant in his home to help assist him with basic tasks. After class, Ary returned home with no groceries, and went straight to the computer to research smart assistants. Upon doing his research on which smart assistant he wanted to purchase he found zero that were to his liking. The main problem being that they were all stand-alone, non-aesthetically pleasing devices. It was at this moment that Ary had the sudden urge to use the bathroom. As he walked into the bathroom, with still no smart assistant on order, and hungry because of not getting groceries he looked at the mirror and thought, “I will combine a mirror with a smart assistant.” This was the perfect idea because not only did it blend into a home, the mirror was also something most people use every day. He began to think about what if the mirror could display my schedule for the current day, and the predicted weather while I am choosing my outfit. The possibilities were endless and therefore the project was born, the Smart Mirror idea was created. Ary got 5 other colleagues to join the team and begin work on this project. At first progress was slow however he believes that with a few months of hard work we could have a serious product on our hands that could be implemented into millions or perhaps billions of households across the world. <br><br>
	
	In summary, the story of our Smart Mirror began with one of our group members wanting a smart mirror for personal use and decided on making a personal assistant even better. We then shared our own project ideas and had a discussion on which project ideas were interesting and we all decided that the Smart Mirror project was interesting to all of us, so we decided that our group project was going to be the Smart Mirror. We got together as a group and discussed the features that we would like to implement to the Mirror in order to save time and create a cleaner look. Our group then decided how the mirror could be accessed, either through voice, mobile application or touch screen, to improve the effectiveness of the item. Additionally, we have brainstormed what brings motivation to create this project, special features and what will the outcome be if we bring our project to life. The plan of this project is to reach the stage where the Smart Mirror is built and programmed, where it can then be physically used in the household and impact the users’ daily life. If the stage couldn’t be reached, the bare minimum we would like it to reach is to get the final prototype to be completed and get feedback from the alpha and beta users to finalise what are some missing functions that users would like to be in the Smart Mirror to then be used in the final product if it occurs. <br><br>
	
	Some dead-ends that we have encountered during the process of our discussions was what makes our product unique compared to other similar products that are already in the market. We had to come up with something that is not completely out of reach, but also unique enough to make people want to use our product. We also had to consider how useful this unique feature will be, as we found that some products offer special functions that are completely useless. Another small problem that we have encountered was how the user would interact with the mirror. We need to understand our users’ behaviours and have found that we need to consider the vocal range of each mirror and offer the ability to possess voice recognition. Users might also go up to the Mirror and touch it. Usability is required to be understood, to show us how accessible the mirror is to the user. In order to avoid or solve these problems, the group must think of every aspect within the Smart Mirror. The reason we would need to make our product unique is to make it stand out and be the only product that provides this function or look. When creating a prototype, we will need to be prepared to face Python, which is used to program the Raspberry Pi B+. This is an additional problem that could cause some dead-ends to the team if the team does not have any programming experience in Python, which is a necessity. Having background knowledge in Python will help reduce dead-end as the programmer knows how Python works and how to code to write and install code within the Raspberry Pi. These problems may be avoided if the team has knowledge of other programming languages. This can assist us with creating different concepts and distinctive ideas which we can use in a Smart Mirror, making it exclusive compared to other merchandise. This will also assist us in thinking about user interaction. To help resolve this problem, we decided that it was necessary to learn the Python language and acquire assistance from knowledgeable programmers. In the long-term, we will have another skill in our pockets that we can use in the future. <br><br>
	
	In order to complete the project as a group, each individual member will need to complete their fair share of work and communicate well to the group members. The positives of working in a group is that it can improve productivity and performance as each member has their own sets of skills and abilities as opposed to working individually as the skills are limited and the workload would be much heavier. A negative effect that may occur in a group project is that some individuals may not cooperate or complete their given tasks, essentially impacting every other member in the group. When one member is lacking, this reduces the group performance and increases the workload for other members, which we would like to avoid in this group project. As a result of one member's lack of effort, this may potentially affect the project's quality, additionally, affecting each member's quality of work due to increased workload, thus affecting the users’ experience and feedback towards our product. <br><br>
	
	The project timeline is structured and planned to follow our timeframe, where each week is designated a few tasks to be completed and is updated with the group in the following meeting during the weeks of progress. In the first four weeks of the project, as a group, we discussed what went well in the plan of the Smart Mirror project, what could be improved and be explained in more detail. We share our own experience in the areas on what the roles include, what would need to be done and each person's ideal roles to ensure that everyone in the group would be happy and will put as much effort into their section of roles. We planned to separate the roles and tasks to their experience in an area otherwise we allocate them to what each individual would like to do as they would enjoy it more, which results in a better performance compared to if the individual received a task that they did not enjoy doing. Overall, our plan is to follow the timeframe created and to keep the group updated on the tasks completed each week in order to tick off the checklist. <br><br>
	
	Some confusing aspects of our Smart Mirror project are knowledge or experience in learning Python, a programming language that is used to write code in order to set up the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, if the user decides to hang the mirror on the wall for more convenience and ease of access, the user will need to measure the weight of the mirror and see if hooks can hold the mirror otherwise they would have to create a french cleat made out of wood and stuck together with nails and glue. In this process, the user will have to have some experience in woodworking otherwise they would have to go out and buy one or get someone that is specialised in that area to complete it for them. From the perspective of another person, without any prior knowledge of what a Smart Mirror does or how it looks like, setting up the smart mirror would be very difficult. Since we have access to the internet which allows us to access information wherever we are, the user can follow a guide from the internet  that shows the user on how to set up the smart mirror. <br><br>
