<h1>Testing</h1>

<hr>

<p>Our group will participate in multiple waves of testing, initially we will have an alpha prototype test for the product. Ideally, this build will be exclusively sent to individuals handpicked by our group. Additionally, the ideal individuals suitable to taking an early look at our product and supplying our group with valuable feedback are either industry specialists, journalists and enthusiastic developers. For this user testing, we think that a group of 30 people would be sufficient to test the program.</p>
<p>The next phase of our development and prototype testing will be the beta build of the smart mirror. This build will be open to the public for purchase and aimed for individuals with the understanding that the product is a pre-release build. The customer at this point in time should expect an un-polished and un-finished product. Similar to the alpha build, it is crucial for the user to provide us with more valuable feedback to improve the product over time. The ideal tester for this stage will be an individual that is interested in a smart assistant through a mirror but as a simple application in the development stage. <br>
The user should be interested in this brand new product, understanding that there will be some faulty functions and willing to work with us, the company, to improve the product over time. </p>
<p> For the testing of our software during the project and on the final version, we will use automated testing which can be defined as a script written by the programmer of functions that are likely to be performed by the end user. Python, the programming language of our application, comes with a diverse choice of tools and libraries for this type of testing. <br>
As described above, we will also rely on customers, who are keen developers and tech journalists, to test a commercial version of our product and provide constructive feedback. We acknowledge that this might delay the final release of our product but it ensures that our product will have the quality and reliability once the development phase is completed. </p>
<p> The main questions that we want to answer trough this testings are:<br>
<ul>
<li> From the tools already available, are they working as expected? </li>
<li> How does the product handle unknown issues? </li>
<li> Are there any data security management issues?</li>
</ul>


<p>Once the problems that are found during the testing phase are fixed and corrected, this will mean that our testing has been successful for the current version of the product. Following this, we will work again on the other testings that should be performed based on users feedback, regarding any malfunction of the Smart Mirror.
We will aim to fix any issues that can interrupt us from achieving our aim and goals during the progress of our project.</p>
