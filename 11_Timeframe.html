In the 		meeting, the group will look through assignment 3 specifications and go through each section one by one to 		gain an understanding of what should be written in each section. Once we have a brief understanding of what 	should be written in each section, we will create a checklist of what needs to be completed in the week or by

	  In week 2, the group will reflect on what was done well in assignment 2 and what could have been improved. By
	  reflecting and obtaining the feedback from assignment 2 means that we can turn what we did badly on in the
	  previous assignment and fix it in the current assignment. After when we have looked back on the pros and cons
	  of our previous assignment, we would discuss with the roles that each individuals would like to do or allocate
	  roles that fit to the individual's past experience. By allocating the roles/jobs to each team member of their
	  liking, will mean that they will enjoy doing the task given and will complete it to the best of their ability.
	  Once the roles/jobs are allocated, the group will discuss with one another of what would make the Smart Mirror 
	  unique in comparison to other products like Google Home.

	  to ensure that work is spread out equally and fairly. When majority of the tasks are completed, we will

	  files and documents into the master branch where all the completed work will be brought together. Another 
	  individual will take all the documents and files from the master branch and put it together on a AWS website
	  where they will host a HTML website that contains CSS and design the website to look neat and tidy. The files
	  and documents will then be added to the website which will then be double checked and be submitted to the

	  In week 5, we would create a physical or paper protoype to create an understand of how it will look, what are
	  the functions of the mirror and how will it help assist the end user. The very first prototype will be simple
	  to ensure that it is not overcomplicated and easy to understand for everyone. After creating the protoype, we
	  would need to receive feedback from random indivduals, which will be done through beta testing, to understand
	  their perspective of the Smart Mirror and use the feedback to improve the prototype. We would ensure to ask 
	  for their consent if they would like to take part of the face-to-face interview or online survey to ensure 
	  that their private information is secured and obtain the necessary feedback to improve the product.

	  In week 6, the plan is to use the feedback from the previous week and come back with the group to discuss what
	  they have recieved as feedback, what could be improved and what was good, and discuss what could be done to 
	  avoid or fix the product that users did not particularly like. By ulitising the feedback, we can now create a
	  brief understanding of what the user wants in the end products and what they would like to be in it. We will 
	  discuss as a group on how to approach and implement these new changes to the Smart Mirror. Adapting from the 
	  first prototype and improving it based on the feedback received, we will have a new and improved prototype to
	  see if any users like or dislike.

	  results to be used and seperate the criticism received. We would then need to update on what the users like

	  During week 8, the group will come back together and discuss how the project is progressing from the previous

	  moving forward or catch up to ensure that they can try complete the main product at the end of week 14. The 
	  roles of the prototype of the Smart Mirror will be allocated to ensure that every individual of the group are 
	  happy and willing to do their role. If not, then the roles will be shifted around to ensure that everyone gets
	  a role they want as they will then complete the task/job to the best of their ability.

	  section of the work given. Use the feedback recieved from the previous weeks and find more information 
	  that could be used to refine the project and make it unique compared to other companies that produces 
	  similiar products to make it stand out. Understand what users want as the product is design for them, not
	  for yourself and use the information receivedd to see how to implement what users requested or improved
	  in to the Smart Mirror project.

	  feedback which will then be discussed as a group and see how we can include what the users really want to
	  see within our product. We will then hand out other roles that are created to each individual group
