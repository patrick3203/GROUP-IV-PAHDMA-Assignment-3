This is for the project idea section – this part is about Aim and goals. We must define what we are aiming for and set smaller goals that will help us get there.


What we want to build: an smart assistance that take voice input and display information on the screen and speaker.

What is needed: software and hardware.
Hardware: raspberry pi and a display.
	
Software: unkown… What can It be:
-	Start with something already on the market i.e. Mango OS Mirror
-	Try some of the other open source voice assistant i.e Mycroft
-	Get started on ours. Code in python, why python? There  big community out there teaching python and many libraries that can be implemented on a our api. Or we can say java, it is just an hypotheses. 
-	This code can use google speech to text library, it can use other libraries for weather forecast, Wikipedia for general search…

Final goam and aim: 	What is the most important part of our project? What are we aiming to achieve? 

To built an smart assistant device. It will take voice input and display information on the screen. After this part is succeeded, we want to build a case so that the device can be easily built behind mirrors frames. 
Create/design a smart assistant that will go unnoticed in the house but is accessible to all kind of people.

Smaller goals:
1)Learn basics of python

2) build a prototype of the device and run tests using Mango OS and Mycroft

3)Develop a unique feature that makes the device useful. Some application/information that is better when delivered through a mirror. 
No clue for something on the living room… I think the weather forecast is better delivered trough our smart mirror. How about the time of the next tram passing by your tram stop.
For the bedroom, for example, when you wake up and is getting ready it can be helpful to have the weather + what is scheduled for your day, sleep status, exercises for the past 3 days status…
