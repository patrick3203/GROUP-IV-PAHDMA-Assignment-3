Group Processes and Communications:

Over the months, the team has gotten closer and better at working together. With the use of video calling replicating a feel of socialising in real life, it has really helped us become more familiar with each other and allowed us to quickly become comfortable around one another. Being able to ‘look’ at each other whilst discussing and sharing ideas enabled us to communicate effectively. With this being said, the teamwork was great and we tried our best to do our fair share of work. Aside from formal meetings, which occurred twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays), we captured communications using a checklist, where each member was able to view their allocated task and which section they should be working on. Each task was colour coded so we were able to identify what was done and what was progressing. We also commented on areas of improvement, advised some extra ideas and left notes for one another, helping us keep on track of the workload. Thanks to Microsoft Teams, we were able to personally message or mention specific members if they were not able to respond to communications right away. If the inactiveness was consistent, some members would have to take up extra work. Despite a slightly increased workload for the team, we remained positive and continued to try our best to get the assignment done.
