GitHub was very confusing initially. As we continued to use it throughout assignment 2, the easier it became to understand and by assignment 3, there were no questions raised about the use of GitHub. Though, our group believes that the GitHub contribution branches are not a good reflection of our individual contributions because it only reflects on our own individual parts. It does not capture the tasks we collaborate on as there is no need to put multiple of the same subheadings in different branches. Our group collaborated through Microsoft Teams and external sources such as Google Docs, where most of the work was done over there, which was then copied over to the GitHub branch where we were able to combine our work to our final copy.
