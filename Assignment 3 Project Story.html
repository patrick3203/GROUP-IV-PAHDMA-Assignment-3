<p>One morning Ari woke up and began his morning routine to get ready for University. When in the bathroom he found himself creating a plan for the day in his head while looking at himself in the mirror brushing his teeth. He then returned to his bedroom where he got changed into the clothes, he would wear to RMIT that day. Before he left his bedroom, he looked at his outfit in the mirror and said to him &ldquo;I hope what I am wearing is appropriate for today&rsquo;s weather.&rdquo; He made his way into his kitchen where he ate breakfast and prepared a lunch to bring to RMIT. Before leaving his house, he made one more glance into the mirror right next to his front door. Ari then left the house and continued on his way to RMIT. About 2 and a half hours later when Ari was in a tutorial for his class, <em>Introduction to Information Technology,</em> Ari remembered that his partner had created a list of items that she would of liked for him to pick up form Woolworths on his way home from RMIT. Ari said to himself, &ldquo;I always forget the list, every time!&rdquo; At this very moment Ari decided that he wanted a smart assistant in his home to help assist him with basic tasks. After class, Ari returned home with no groceries, and went straight to the computer to research smart assistant. Upon doing his research on which smart assistant he wanted to purchase he found zero that were to his liking. The main problem being that they were all stand-alone, non-aesthetically pleasing devices. It was at this moment that Ari had the sudden urge to use the bathroom. As he walked into the bathroom, with still no smart assistant on order, and hungry because of not getting groceries he looked at the mirror and thought, &ldquo;I will combine a mirror with a smart assistant.&rdquo; This was the perfect idea because not only did it blend into a home, the mirror was also something most people use every day. He began to think what if the mirror could display my schedule for the current day, and the predicted weather while I am choosing my outfit. The possibilities were endless and therefore the project was born, the <em>Smart Mirror</em> idea was created. Ari got 5 other colleagues to join the team and begin work on this project. At first progress was slow however he believes that with a few months of hard work we could have a serious product on our hands that could be implemented into million or perhaps billions of households across the world.</p>
