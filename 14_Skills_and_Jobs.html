<h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>

<hr>

<p>
	The perfect team to work on this project would be composed of experienced software developers, a creative user interface designer and a market person with start-up products experience. <br><br>
As the project manager, I would oversee the workflow of the project development and take care of other business nuanced decisions.
<br><br>

Below is a position description for each of new team members:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><b>Software Developer:</b> Main role is the development of the software and provide guidance and direction to the Programmer and the UI Designer. He should analyse the needs of our product and plan on how each application should work together. This role is also responsible for documenting every aspect of the program and ensure there are testing and upgrades in places to maintain the functionality of the software. We would be looking for a recent graduate of computer science or software engineering.
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><b>Programmer:</b> This role is for an experienced programmer passionate about building new things and working in new projects. We need someone with experience programming in Phyton and SQL data base and with interest to keep on learning during the job. Artificial intelligence experience is also desirable as that could contribute to the functions of our smart assistance. The programmer needs to be experienced and capable of running projects with a small team because he will be the main employee responsible for coding our application. The right candidate has a diverse portfolio with interesting projects in Phyton and other languages.
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><b>User Interface Designer:</b> Responsible for developing the interface that our customer will interact with. The designer needs to be a motivated person who enjoys exploring ideas and working in a diverse team. Working under the supervision of the software developer, our UI person will present ideas to the group and work together to create our program interface. Excitement to find new ways to display information through a mirror and commitment for the ultimate customer experience is a must. For this role, skills and personality is more important than the working experience.
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><b>Marketing Manager:</b> This role is an ideal position for a data driven person who enjoys content creation and has experience with customer relationships. The market manager will have the responsibility to search for ways to attract customerâ€™s attention and grow business relationships with possible industry partners. Experience and good understanding of the tech market field is a must.
	</li>
</ul>
